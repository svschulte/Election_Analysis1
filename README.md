# Election_Analysis1
During the Challenge I was able to help the election commission to find required data to complete the election audit. 
I was basing on data provided in CSV file "election_results" for my analisys. I was using Python language and Visual Studio code interpreter to analize the data. As a result of my analisys I was able to determine the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, the county with the highest turnout. I could determine percantage of vote for each candidate and find out the winner of the election.
During the audit, I found out that in the congressional elections there were total of 369 711 votes. The votes were split between counties as following:
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
As we can see, the largest county turnout was in Denver.
The votes got spread between candidates as following:
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
With that said, we can see that Deana DeGette won the election with a big margin.
